After years of being a fullstack developer I got my chance to manage a team and be in charge of a product.

My tasks where clear:
- Hire and build a team
- Develop the product almost from scratch
- Go live and don't crash 

### Not understanding points
I think the most difficult part of Scrum is to point the stories.

When I had to explained to my team I used this analogie:

A Story/Task is race that the whole team has to run and the points is the distance to run

This worked for a while but from time to time we had to reset and I would have to explain it over.

I think that instead of using points its better to use size: XS, S, M, L, XL and that's it.

Having words instead of numbers make it easier to deattach ourselves from the notion of time and here's where I think Scrum gets a bit messy

It start by saying that you don't put a timeframe on stories but then you have fixed timeframe, the sprint, where you have to put the stories on and here's where the team get confused most of the time.

When they have to agree what stories to do in fixed period of time
