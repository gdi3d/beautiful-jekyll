I was feeling hungry that day, but I never imagined that I could end up liked I did. Knowing all that I know today, next time I will be more careful.

If you're here thinking: **'how can someone eat some much!! ðŸ¤¯'** I'm sorry to tell you that the title was just clickbait. (Although I do eat a lot of real cookies )

In this post, I'm going to show how cookies on sites have gone wild.

I'm not new to cookies nor privacy issues on the internet, but a few days ago I was surprised when I accidentally saw how many cookies outlook was using when I opened my email.

> I'm not saying that cookies count has a direct relation with privacy. But I'm surprised at how many each site ends up installing.

Some context before I post the screenshots:

- I live in Europe, so the GDPR banners are shown on almost every site and I accepted the default cookie options.
- I was logged in to some sites.

Here's the list, ordered from biggest to smallest (screenshots below list):
