> TL;DR [https://gdi3d.github.io/change-youtube-videos-brightness/](https://gdi3d.github.io/change-youtube-videos-brightness/)

<video width="480" controls>
    <source src="/img/kantcshit-sample.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

I usually watch movies or YouTube videos with my external monitor. But sometimes the video is too dark and turning up the monitor's brightness it's not enough.

So I decided to create a small javascript snippet to fix this issue in any web that has a video on it.

It's call **Kant C ðŸ’©** (can't see shit) and you can use it by pasting the snippet in the javascript console of your browser.

# Demo

You can test it out on [https://gdi3d.github.io/change-youtube-videos-brightness/demo.html](https://gdi3d.github.io/change-youtube-videos-brightness/demo.html)

# How does it work?

It uses the [*filter*](https://gdi3d.github.io/change-youtube-videos-brightness/) properties of CSS and it's applied to the *video* tag element present on the site.

# It's safe?

Yes, but feel free to inspect the code at [https://github.com/gdi3d/change-youtube-videos-brightness](https://github.com/gdi3d/change-youtube-videos-brightness)
